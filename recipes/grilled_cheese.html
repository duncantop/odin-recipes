    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      In my humble opinion, this crispy, crunchy, cheesy masterpiece is the
      ultimate grilled cheese sandwich. Make sure you follow some basic rules
      for this to work properly. Only use airy, nutritionally insignificant
      white bread. Use a nice sharp cheddar and be sure to use a quality
      non-stick pan over medium to medium-low heat.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
      <li>2 slices white bread</li>
      <li>Â½ cup shredded extra sharp Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-low
        heat. Place bread slices in the skillet on top of the melted butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread about 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese on one slice of bread; place the
        other slice of bread, butter-side up, on top of the cheese. Spread about
        2 tablespoons of cheese on top of the sandwich.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter in the skillet next to the
        sandwich. Flip the sandwich onto the melted butter so that the
        cheese-side is facing down. Spread remaining cheese on top of the
        sandwich. Cook sandwich until cheese on the bottom is crispy and
        caramelized, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip sandwich and cook until cheese is
        crispy and caramelized on the other side, another 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
